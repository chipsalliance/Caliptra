# Compliance with OCP Tenets

<!---
Please describe how this Specification complies with the OCP tenets. 
A full explanation of the OCP core tenets can be seen [here](https://146a55aca6f00848c565-a7635525d40ac1c70300198708936b4e.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/bf648bb75091907147e76846cad590f402660d2e.pdf).

## Openness

OCP L.O.C.K. source for RTL and firmware will be licensed using the Apache 2.0 license. The specific mechanics and hosting of the code are work in progress due to CHIPS alliance timelines. Future versions of this spec will point to the relevant resources.

## Efficiency

OCP L.O.C.K. is used to generate and load keys for use of encrypting user data prior to storing data at rest and decrypting stored user data at rest when read. So, it cannot yield a measurable impact on system efficiency.

## Impact

OCP L.O.C.K. enables consistency and transparency to a foundational area of security of media encryption keys such that no firmware in the device ever has access to a media encryption key. Furthermore, no decrypted media encryption key exists in the device when power is removed from the device.

## Scale

OCP L.O.C.K. is a committed intercept for Cloud silicon for Google and Microsoft. This scale covers both a significant portion of the Cloud market in hyperscale and enterprise.

## Sustainability

The goal of OCP L.O.C.K. is to eliminate the need to destroy storage devices (e.g., SSDs) in the Cloud market by providing a mechanism that increases the confidence that a media encryption key within the device is deleted in a crypto-erase. This enables repurposing the device and or components on the device at end of use or end of life. Given the size of the Cloud market this provides a significant reduction of e-waste.

# Base specification

## Introduction

OCP L.O.C.K. (Layered Open-source Cryptographic Key management) is a feature set conditionally compiled into Caliptra Subsystem 2.1+, which provides secure key management for Data-At-Rest protection in self-encrypting storage devices.

OCP L.O.C.K. was originally created as part of the Open Compute Project (OCP). The major revisions of the OCP L.O.C.K. specifications are published as part of Caliptra at OCP, as OCP L.O.C.K. is an extension to Caliptra. The evolving source code and documentation for Caliptra are in the repository within the CHIPS Alliance Project, a Series of LF Projects, LLC.

OCP L.O.C.K. may be integrated within a variety of self-encrypting storage devices, and is not restricted exclusively to NVMe.

## Background

In the life of a storage device in a datacenter, the device leaves the supplier, a customer writes user data to the device, and then the device is decommissioned. Customer data is not allowed to leave the data center. The cloud service provider (CSP) needs high confidence that the storage device leaving the datacenter is secure. The current default CSP policy to ensure this level of security is to destroy the drive. Other policies may exist that leverage drive capabilities (e.g., Purge), but are not generally deemed inherently trustworthy by these CSPs [@{self-encrypting-deception}]. This produces significant e-waste and inhibits any re-use/recycling.

Self-encrypting drives (SEDs) store data encrypted at rest to media encryption keys (MEKs). SEDs include the following building blocks:

- The storage media that holds data at rest.
- An encryption engine which performs line-rate encryption and decryption of data as it enters and exits the drive.
- A controller which exposes host-side APIs for managing the lifecycle of MEKs.

MEKs may be bound to user credentials, which the host must provide to the drive in order for the associated data to be readable. A given MEK may be bound to one or more credentials. This model is captured in the TCG Opal [@{tcg-opal}] specification.

MEKs may be securely purged, to effectively purge all data which was encrypted to the MEK. To purge an MEK, it is sufficient for the controller to purge all copies of it, or a key with which it was protected.

## Threat model

The protected asset is the user data stored at rest on the drive. The adversary profile extends up to nation-states in terms of capabilities.

Adversary capabilities include:

- Interception of a storage device in the supply chain.
- Theft of a storage device from a data center.
- Destructively inspecting a stolen device.
- Running arbitrary firmware on a stolen device.
  - This includes attacks where vendor firmware signing keys have been compromised.
- Attempting to glitch execution of code running on general-purpose cores.
- Stealing debug core dumps or UART/serial logs from a device while it is operating in a data center, and later stealing the device.
- Gaining access to any class secrets, global secrets, or symmetric secrets shared between the device and an external entity.
- Executing code within a virtual machine on a multi-tenant host offered by the cloud service provider which manages an attached storage device.
- Accessing all device design documents, code, and RTL.

Given the above adversary profile, the following are a list of vulnerabilities that OCP L.O.C.K. is designed to mitigate.

- MEKs managed by storage controller firmware are compromised due to implementation bugs or side channels.
- MEKs purged by storage controller firmware are recoverable via invasive techniques.
- MEKs are not fully bound to user credentials due to implementation bugs.
- MEKs are bound to user credentials which are compromised by a vulnerable host.
- Cryptographic erasure was not performed properly due to a buggy host.

## OCP L.O.C.K. goals

OCP L.O.C.K. is being defined to improve drive security. In an SED that takes Caliptra with OCP L.O.C.K. features enabled, Caliptra will act as a Key Management Block (KMB). The KMB will be the only entity that can read MEKs and program them into the SED's cryptographic engine. The KMB will expose services to controller firmware which will allow the controller to transparently manage each MEK's lifecycle, without being able to access the raw MEK itself.

The OCP L.O.C.K. KMB satisfies the following properties:

- Prevents leakage of media keys via firmware vulnerabilities or side channels, by isolating MEKs to a trusted hardware block.
- Binds MEKs to a given set of externally-supplied access keys, provisioned with replay-resistant transport security such that they can be injected without trusting the host.
- Uses epoch keys for attestable epoch-based cryptographic purge.
- Is able to be used in conjunction with the Opal or Key Per I/O [@{tcg-kpio}] storage device specifications.

### Non-goals

The following areas are out of scope for this project.

- Compliance with IEEE 1619 2025 requirements around key scope, i.e. restricting a given MEK to only encrypt a maximum of 2<sup>44</sup> 128-bit blocks. Controller firmware will be responsible for enforcing this.
- Compliance with Common Criteria requirement FCS_CKM.1.1(c) [@{cpp-fde}] when supporting derived MEKs. Key Per I/O calls for DEKs to be injected into the device. To support OCP L.O.C.K.'s goals around enabling cryptographic purge, before the injected DEK is used to encrypt user data, it is first conditioned with an on-device secret that can be securely zeroized. FCS_CKM.1.1(c) currently does not allow injected keys to be thus conditioned and therefore does not allow for cryptographic purge under the Key Per I/O model. A storage device that integates OCP L.O.C.K. and aims to be compliant with this Common Criteria requirement may not support Key Per I/O.
- Authorization for CEK/DEK/MEK rotation, or binding a given MEK to a particular locking range. The controller firmware is responsible for these.

### Integration verification

A product which integrates OCP L.O.C.K. will be expected to undergo an OCP S.A.F.E. review, to ensure that the controller firmware correctly invokes OCP L.O.C.K. services.

## Architecture

The following figure shows the basic high-level blocks of OCP L.O.C.K.

![OCP L.O.C.K. high level blocks](./diagrams/architecture_diagram.drawio.svg){#fig:architecture-diagram}

OCP L.O.C.K.'s KMB protects MEKs using the following keys:

- A controller-supplied data encryption key (DEK). The DEK is the mechanism by which the controller enforces privilege separation between user credentials under TCG Opal, as well as the mechanism used to model injected MEKs under Key Per I/O.

- A controller-supplied epoch key (CEK), provided by the controller firmware when loading each MEK. The CEK can be zeroized to perform a cryptographic purge. The controller firmware is responsible for managing and rotating this key, and for ensuring that MEKs are not loaded while the CEK is zeroized.

- A KMB-managed fuse epoch key (FEK), derived from secrets held in device fuses that are only accessible by the KMB. The FEK may be zeroized and regenerated a small number of times, providing assurance that an advanced adversary cannot recover key material that had been in use by the drive prior to the FEK zeroization. KMB does not allow MEKs to be loaded while the FEK is zeroized. KMB can report whether the FEK is zeroized and therefore whether the drive is clean.

- Zero or more partial MEKs (PMEKs), each of which is a cryptographically-strong value randomly generated by KMB, encrypted at rest using a key derived from the FEK as well as an externally-supplied access key. The access key is never stored persistently within the device. PMEKs enable multi-party authorization flows: the access key for each PMEK to which an MEK is bound must be provided to the drive before the MEK can be loaded. Access keys are protected in transit using HPKE [@{ietf-rfc9180}] keypairs. This enables use-cases where the access key is served to the drive from a remote entity, without having to trust the host to which the drive is attached. To bind a given locking range to multiple external authorities, the controller can generate multiple PMEKs and use them to load the locking range's MEK. PMEK access keys may be held at rest in a remote key management service. An MEK may be bound to zero PMEKs, which allows for legacy Opal or Key Per I/O flows.

The keys listed here are used together to derive an MEK secret. The MEK secret is used in one of two flows:

- **MEK encryption** - the controller obtains a random MEK from KMB, encrypted by the MEK secret, and can load the encrypted MEK into the encryption engine later via KMB. This supports Opal use-cases.
- **MEK derivation** - the controller instructs KMB to load the MEK secret into the encryption engine as a derived MEK. This supports Key Per I/O use-cases.

MEKs are never visible to controller firmware. Controller firmware instructs KMB to load MEKs into the key cache of the encryption engine, using standard interfaces described in @sec:interfaces. Each MEK has associated vendor-defined metadata, to identify for example the namespace and LBA range to be encrypted by the MEK.

All MEKs are removed from the encryption engine on a power cycle or during zeroization of the storage device.

All keys randomly generated by KMB are generated using a DRBG seeded by Caliptra's TRNG. The DRBG may be reseeded using entropy provided by the host.

### Host APIs

The DEK can be modeled using existing TCG Opal or Key Per I/O host APIs.

Rotation of the FEK and CEK, management of PMEKs and PMEK access keys, and injection of host entropy, require additional host APIs beyond those available in TCG Opal or Key Per I/O. Such APIs are beyond the scope of the present document.

### Key hierarchy

![OCP L.O.C.K. key hierarchy](./diagrams/key_hierarchy.drawio.svg){#fig:key-hierarchy}

### PMEKs

PMEKs are the mechanism by which KMB enforces multi-party authorization as a precondition to loading an MEK. PMEKs exist in one of two states: locked or ready. In both these states the PMEK is encrypted to a key known only to KMB.

- A locked PMEK's encryption key is derived from the FEK as well as an externally-supplied access key. The locked PMEK is held at rest by controller firmware.
- A ready PMEK's encryption key (the Ready PMEK Encryption Key) is a volatile key held within KMB which is lazily generated. Ready PMEKs are held in controller firmware memory. Lazy generation allows injected host entropy to contribute to the key's generation.

The externally-supplied access key is encrypted in transit using an HPKE public key held by KMB. The "ready" state allows the HPKE keypair to be rotated after the access key has been provisioned to the storage device, without removing the ability for KMB to decrypt the PMEK when later loading an MEK bound to that PMEK.

For each PMEK to which a given MEK is bound, the host is expected to invoke a command to supply the PMEK's encrypted access key. Upon receipt the controller firmware passes that encrypted access key to KMB, along with the locked PMEK, to produce the ready PMEK which is cached in controller memory. This is done prior to the controller firmware actually loading the MEK, and is performed once for each PMEK to which a given MEK is bound.

#### Transport encryption for PMEK access keys

KMB maintains a set of HPKE keypairs, one per HPKE algorithm that KMB supports. Each HPKE public key is endorsed with a certificate that is generated by KMB and signed by Caliptra's DICE identity. HPKE keypairs are randomly generated on KMB startup, and mapped to unique handles. Keypairs may be periodically rotated and are lost when the drive resets. Controller firmware is responsible for enumerating the available HPKE public keys and exposing them to the user via a host interface.

When a user wishes to generate or ready a PMEK (which is required prior to loading any MEKs bound to that PMEK), the user performs the following steps:

1. Select the HPKE public key and obtain its certificate from the storage device.
2. Validate the HPKE certificate and attached DICE certificate chain.
3. Encrypt their access key to the HPKE public key.
4. Transmit the encrypted access key to the storage device.

Upon receipt, KMB will unwrap the access key and proceed to generate or ready the PMEK.

Upon drive reset, the HPKE keypairs are regenerated, and any access keys for PMEKs that had been made ready prior to the reset will need to be re-provisioned in order to transition those PMEKs to a ready state again.

##### Algorithm support

KMB supports the following HPKE algorithms:

- P-384 ECDH
- Hybridized ML-KEM-1024 with P-384 ECDH

The following two diagrams illustrate the detailed cryptographic operations involved in unwrapping the access key using each of these algorithms. Subsequent diagrams elide these details and represent the operation as "HPKE unwrap".

##### PMEK access key unwrap (ECDH)

![PMEK access key unwrap with ECDH](./diagrams/pmek_access_key_ecdh_unwrap.drawio.svg){#fig:access-key-ecdh-unwrap}

##### PMEK access key unwrap (Hybrid ML-KEM + ECDH)

The only difference here from the above flow is how the HPKE Shared Secret is derived. Operations which produce an AES key and IV from that shared secret are identical to the prior flow, and are omitted here for brevity.

![PMEK access key unwrap with hybrid ML-KEM + ECDH](./diagrams/pmek_access_key_hybrid_unwrap.drawio.svg){#fig:access-key-hybrid-unwrap}

#### PMEK lifecycle

PMEKs can be generated, made ready, and have their access keys rotated.

##### PMEK generation

Controller firmware may request that KMB generate a PMEK, bound to a given access key. KMB performs the following steps:

1. Unwrap the given PMEK access key using the HPKE keypair held within KMB.
2. Randomly generate a PMEK.
3. Derive a PMEK encryption key from the FEK and the decrypted access key.
4. Encrypt the PMEK to the PMEK encryption key.
5. Return the encrypted PMEK to the controller firmware.

Controller firmware may then store the encrypted PMEK in persistent storage.

To mitigate against cryptographic attacks on the HPKE keypair that rely on repeated invocations of this command, this command is rate-limited.

![PMEK generation](./diagrams/pmek_generate.drawio.svg){#fig:pmek-generation}

##### PMEK readying

Encrypted PMEKs stored at rest in persistent storage are considered "locked", and must be made ready before they can be used to load an MEK. Ready PMEKs are also encrypted when handled by controller firmware, to the Ready PMEK Encryption Key. Ready PMEKs do not survive across device reset.

To ready a PMEK, KMB performs the following steps:

1. Unwrap the given PMEK access key using the HPKE keypair held within KMB.
2. Derive the PMEK encryption key from the FEK and the decrypted access key.
3. Decrypt the PMEK using the PMEK encryption key.
4. Encrypt the PMEK using the Ready PMEK Encryption Key.
5. Return the re-encrypted "ready" PMEK to the controller firmware.

Controller firmware may then stash the encrypted ready PMEK in volatile storage, and later provide it to the KMB when loading an MEK, as described in @sec:meks.

To mitigate against cryptographic attacks on the HPKE keypair that rely on repeated invocations of this command, this command is rate-limited.

![PMEK readying](./diagrams/pmek_ready.drawio.svg){#fig:pmek-readying}

##### PMEK access key rotation

The access key to which a PMEK is bound may be rotated. The user must prove that they have knowledge of both the old and new access key before a rotation is allowed. This is accomplished using a slight variation on the usual access key import flow. When a new access key is provided to KMB during a rotation, the new access key is double-encrypted: first to the old access key, and then to the HPKE public key. KMB performs the following steps:

1. Unwrap the given old access key and encrypted new access key using the HPKE keypair held within KMB.
2. Decrypt the new access key using the old access key.
3. Derive the old PMEK encryption key from the FEK and the decrypted old access key.
4. Derive the new PMEK encryption key from the FEK and the decrypted new access key.
5. Decrypt the PMEK using the old PMEK encryption key.
6. Encrypt the PMEK using the new PMEK encryption key.
7. Return the re-encrypted PMEK to the controller firmware.

Controller firmware then zeroizes the old encrypted PMEK and stores the new encrypted PMEK in persistent storage.

To mitigate against cryptographic attacks on the HPKE keypair that rely on repeated invocations of this command, this command is rate-limited.

![PMEK access key rotation](./diagrams/pmek_access_key_rotation.drawio.svg){#fig:pmek-access-key-rotation}

### DEKs

Controller firmware provides the DEK (Data Encryption Key) to KMB when generating, loading, or deriving an MEK. The DEK is used in a KDF, along with the FEK, CEK, and PMEKs, to derive the MEK secret, as illustrated in @sec:mek-secret-derivation.

#### Use when generating or loading an MEK

In this flow, the DEK may be encrypted by a user's Opal C_PIN. Legacy controller firmware logic which decrypts MEKs can be repurposed to produce the DEK.

![Example controller flow to decrypt a DEK based on a host-provided Opal C_PIN](./diagrams/dek_decryption.drawio.svg){#fig:dek-decryption}

#### Use when deriving an MEK

In this flow, the DEK may be the imported key associated with a Key Per I/O key tag.

Note: in this flow, KMB accepts 512-bit DEKs, to support derivation of AES-XTS-512 keys. There are arguments that a 256-bit DEK would be sufficient, as an AES-XTS-512 key is interpreted as a pair of 256-bit keys and therefore can be said to have a total of 256 bits of security strength. However, other interpretations hold that a 512-bit-wide AES key requires 512 bits of input key material. KMB accepts 512-bit DEKs as a conservative measure.

![Example controller flow to accept an injected DEK](./diagrams/dek_injection.drawio.svg){#fig:dek-injection}

### MEKs {#sec:meks}

KMB can encrypt randomly-generated MEKs, or compute derived MEKs.

#### Encrypting and decrypting a randomly-generated MEK

![MEK encryption and decryption](./diagrams/mek_encryption.drawio.svg){#fig:mek-encryption}

#### Deriving an MEK

![MEK derivation](./diagrams/mek_derivation.drawio.svg){#fig:mek-derivation}

#### MEK secret derivation {#sec:mek-secret-derivation}

This diagram provides additional details on how the CEK, DEK, FEK, and PMEKs are mixed together to produce the MEK secret, which then either encrypts/decrypts a random MEK or is used to compute a derived MEK.

![MEK secret derivation](./diagrams/mek_secret_derivation.drawio.svg){#fig:mek-secret-derivation}

### FEKs and CEKs

KMB supports a pair of epoch keys: the FEK and CEK. Both must be available, i.e. non-zeroized, in order for MEKs to be loaded.

- The **FEK** is derived from secrets held in Caliptra's fuse block, and is never visible outside of Caliptra. If the FEK is zeroized, KMB does not allow MEKs to be loaded.
- The **CEK** is managed by controller firmware, and may be stored in flash. If the CEK is zeroized, controller firmware is responsible for enforcing that MEKs are not loaded.

Zeroizing either the FEK or CEK is equivalent to performing a cryptographic purge. FEK zeroization is effectively a "hard" purge, as it is highly difficult to recover secrets from a zeroized fuse bank.

The FEK is derived from a series of N 256-bit ratchet secrets present in a fuse bank, dubbed R<sub>0</sub>..R<sub>N-1</sub>, where N is between 4 and 16 inclusive. The vendor is responsible for determining the number of ratchet secrets available in fuses. These ratchet secrets have the following properties:

- Can individually transition from all-zeroes ‚Üí randomized ‚Üí all-ones. R<sub>X</sub> is only randomized once R<sub>X-1</sub> has transitioned to all-ones.
- Programmable via the Caliptra fuse controller.
- Only readable by Caliptra Core, via fuse registers.
  - Internally, the fuse registers will be treated like the DICE UDS, in that their contents can only be deposited into Key Vault slots, without direct visibility by Caliptra firmware.

Caliptra features a [Stable Identity](https://github.com/chipsalliance/caliptra-sw/blob/main-2.x/rom/dev/README.md#derivation-of-the-key-ladder-for-stable-identity) Key (SIK), which is a non-ratchetable secret derived from the DICE UDS, the current value of the field entropy fuse bank, as well as the current lifecycle and debug states. The SIK can be used to protect long-lived data. Caliptra's Stable Identity feature is implemented in terms of a key ladder, with different keys for different firmware SVNs, with the property that firmware whose SVN is X can only obtain Stable Identity keys bound to major versions less than or equal to X. The SIK used by KMB is the key ladder secret bound to SVN 0, ensuring that firmware of any SVN can wield it.

The FEK is derived from the SIK, along with the currently-active ratchet secret. In normal cases, if the currently-active ratchet secret is unprogrammed or zeroized, the FEK is disabled and no MEKs are allowed to be loaded. KMB exposes a command that allows the owner to permanently opt into an operating mode where the FEK is derived solely from the SIK. In this mode, data written to the storage device can no longer be purged via FEK zeroization.

To satisfy FIPS 140 zeroization requirements once the FEK can no longer be zeroized, the FIPS boundary will need to include CEK zeroization functionality in the storage controller firmware.

![FEK derivation](./diagrams/fek_derivation.drawio.svg){#fig:fek-derivation}

#### FEK lifecycle

A device out of manufacturing is required to have programmed the first FEK. KMB exposes the following commands to manage the FEK lifecycle:

+----------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Command              | Description                            |
+======================+========================================+
| PROGAM_NEXT_FEK      | Programs a random ratchet secret into  |
|                      | the next slot. Upon success, if the    |
|                      | CEK is programmed, MEKs may be loaded. |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------+
| ZEROIZE_CURRENT_FEK  | Sets the current ratchet secret fuses  |
|                      | to all-ones. May be re-attempted if    |
|                      | an error caused the active fuse bank   |
|                      | to be left in an invalid state. Upon   |
|                      | success, MEKs may not be loaded.       |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------+
| ENABLE_PERMANENT_FEK | Enables a mode where the FEK is        |
|                      | derived solely from SIK. May be        |
|                      | re-attempted if an error caused the    |
|                      | active fuse bank to be left in an      |
|                      | invalid state. Upon success, if        |
|                      | the CEK is programmed, MEKs may be     |
|                      | loaded.                                |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------+

If an error causes the active fuse bank to be left in an invalid state, MEKs may not be loaded. If this state persists, the device is unusable.

![FEK & CEK state machine with four ratchet slots](./diagrams/fek_cek_rotation.drawio.svg){#fig:fek-cek-rotation}

#### CEK lifecycle

Controller firmware is responsible for enforcing that CEK programming and zeroization follows the state machine above. Specifically:

- The CEK may only be programmed once the FEK is available.
- The FEK may only be zeroized once the CEK is zeroized.

### Random key generation via DRBG

KMB generates multiple kinds of random keys. It does so using randomness obtained from a DRBG, which is seeded from Caliptra's TRNG and which may be reseeded with entropy from the host.

![DRBG usage](./diagrams/drbg_diagram.drawio.svg){#fig:drbg-usage}

### Boot-time initialization

At initial boot, KMB firmware performs the following steps:

- Determines whether an FEK is available, based on the fuse configuration. If an FEK is unavailable, KMB enters a mode where MEKs are not allowed to be loaded.
- Initializes random HPKE keypairs for each supported algorithm, and maps them to unique handles.

---

## Interfaces {#sec:interfaces}

OCP L.O.C.K. defines two interfaces:

- The **encryption engine interface** is exposed from the vendor-implemented encryption engine to KMB, and defines a standard mechanism for programming MEKs and control messages.
- The **mailbox interface** is exposed from KMB to storage controller firmware, and enables the controller to manage MEKs and associated keys.

### KMB ‚Üí encryption engine interface

This section defines the interface between the Key Management Block (KMB) and an encryption engine. An encryption engine is used to encrypt/decrypt user data and its design and implementation are vendor specific. MEKs are generated or derived within KMB and used by the encryption engine to encrypt and decrypt user data. This interface is used to load MEKs from KMB to the encryption engine or to cause the encryption engine to unload (i.e., remove) loaded MEKs. The MEKs transferred between the KMB and the encryption engine shall not be accessible by the controller firmware.

#### Overview

The encryption engine uses a stored MEK to encrypt and decrypt user data. For the purposes of this specification, the entity within the encryption engine used to store the MEKs is called the key cache. Each encryption and decryption of user data is coupled to a specific MEK which is stored in the key cache bound to a unique identifier, called metadata. Each (metadata, MEK) pair is also associated with additional information, called aux, which is used neither as MEK nor an identifier, but has some additional information about the pair. Therefore, the key cache as an entity which stores (metadata, aux, MEK) tuples.

To ensure that MEKs are only ever visible to KMB and the encryption engine, KMB is the only entity which can load and unload (metadata, aux, MEK) tuples. Controller firmware arbitrates all operations in the KMB to encryption engine interface, and is therefore responsible for managing which MEK is loaded in the key cache. Controller firmware has full control on metadata and optional aux. @fig:encryption-engine is an illustration of the KMB ‚Üí encryption engine interface which shows:

- The tuple for loading an MEK.
- The metadata for unloading an MEK.
- An example of a key cache configuration within the encryption engine.

![KMB to encryption engine SFR interface](./diagrams/kmb_ee.drawio.svg){#fig:encryption-engine}

#### Special Function Registers

KMB uses Special Function Registers (SFRs) to communicate with the encryption engine as shown in @tbl:kmb-ee-sfrs and each of the following subsections which describe the registers.

+------------------+----------------+-----------+-------------------------+

SFR_BASE is an address that is configured within KMB. The integrator should make sure that KMB can access these SFRs through these addresses.

##### Control register

@tbl:ee-ctrl-sfr defines the Control register used to sequence the execution of a command and obtain the status of that command.

+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

From the KMB, the Control register is the register to write a command and receive its execution result. From its counterpart, the encryption engine, the Control register is used to receive a command and write its execution result.

The expected change flow of the Control register to handle a command is as follows:

1. If **RDY** is set to 1b, then KMB writes **CMD** and **EXE**
    1. **CMD:** either 1h, 2h or 3h
    2. **EXE:** 1b
2. The encryption engine writes** **ERR** and **DN**
    1. **ERR:** either 0b or a non-zero value depending on the execution result
    2. **DN:** 1b
3. The KMB writes **DN**
    1. **DN:** 1b
4. The encryption engine writes **CMD**, **ERR**, **DN** and **EXE**
    1. **CMD:** 0h
    2. **ERR:** 0h
    3. **DN:** 0b
    4. **EXE:** 0b

The KMB therefore interacts with the Control register as follows in the normal circumstance:

1. The KMB writes **CMD** and **EXE**
    1. **CMD:** either 1h, 2h or 3h
    2. **EXE:** 1b
2. The KMB waits **DN** to be 1
3. The KMB writes **DN**
    1. **DN:** 1b
4. The KMB waits **DN** to be 0

Since the Control register is in fact a part of the encryption engine whose implementation can be unique to each vendor, behaviors of the Control register with the unexpected flow are left for vendors. For example, a vendor who wants robustness might integrate a write-lock into the Control register in order to prevent two almost simultaneous writes on EXE bit.

##### Metadata register

@tbl:ee-metd-sfr defines the Metadata register used to pass additional data related to the MEK.

Table: Offset SFR_Base + 10h: METD ‚Äì Metadata {#tbl:ee-metd-sfr}

+-------+------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Bytes | Type | Reset | Description                                                  |
+=======+======+=======+==============================================================+
| 19:00 | RW   | 0h    | **Metadata (METD):** This field specifies metadata that      |
|       |      |       | is vendor specific and specifies the entry in the encryption |
|       |      |       | engine for the MEK.                                          |
+-------+------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

The KMB and the encryption engine must be the only components which have access to MEKs. Each MEK is associated with a unique identifier, which may be visible to other components, in order for the MEK to be used for any key-related operations including data I/O. The **METD** field is used as such an identifier.

Instead of generating a random and unique identifier within the KMB while loading an MEK, the KMB takes an **METD** value as input from the controller firmware and write to the **METD** register without any modification for the sake of the following reasons:

1. A vendor does not need to implement an additional algorithm to map between identifiers in its own system and in the KMB
2. A vendor-unique key-retrieval algorithm can easily be leveraged into a **METD**-generation algorithm

In order to reduce ambiguity, two examples of the **METD** field will be given: Logical Block Addressing (LBA) range-based metadata; and key-tag based metadata.

When an SSD stores data with address-based encryption, an MEK can be uniquely identified by a (LBA range, Namespace ID) pair. Then, the (LBA range, Namespace ID) pair can be leveraged into **METD** as on @fig:lba-nsid-layout.

![LBA range based metadata format](./diagrams/metadata_register_lba_nsid.drawio.svg){#fig:lba-nsid-layout}

Address-based encryption is not the only encryption mechanism in SSDs. For example, in TCG Key Per I/O, an MEK is selected by a key tag, which does not map to an address. @fig:key-tag-layout shows an example of **METD** in such cases.

![Key tag based metadata format](./diagrams/metadata_register_key_tag.drawio.svg){#fig:key-tag-layout}

The above examples are not the only possible values of **METD**. Vendors are encouraged to design and use their own **METD** if it fits better to their system.

##### Auxiliary Data register

@tbl:ee-aux-sfr defines the Auxiliary Data register used to pass additional vendor-specific data related to the MEK.

Table: Offset SFR_Base + 20h: AUX ‚Äì Auxiliary Data {#tbl:ee-aux-sfr}

+-------+------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Bytes | Type | Reset | Description                                              |
+=======+======+=======+==========================================================+
| 31:00 | RW   | 0h    | **Auxiliary Data (AUX):** This field specifies auxiliary |
|       |      |       | data associated to the MEK.                              |
+-------+------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------+

The **AUX** field supports vendor-specific features on MEKs. The KMB itself only supports fundamental functionalities in order to minimize attack surfaces on MEKs. Moreover, vendors are free to design and implement their own MEK-related functionality within the encryption engine, as long as that functionality cannot be used to exfiltrate MEKs. In order to support these functionalities, some data may be associated and stored with an MEK, and the **AUX** field facilitates this association.

When the controller firmware instructs the KMB to load an MEK, the controller firmware is expected to provide an **AUX** value. Similar to the **METD** field, the KMB will write the **AUX** value into the Auxiliary Data register without any modification.

One simple use case of the **AUX** field is to store an offset of initialization vector or nonce. It can also be used in a more complicated use case. Here is an example. Suppose that there exists a vendor who wants to design a system which supports several modes of operation through the encryption engine while using the KMB. Then, a structure of **AUX** value as on @fig:aux-register-format-example can be used.

![Auxiliary data format example](./diagrams/aux_register_iv_nonce.drawio.svg){#fig:aux-register-format-example}

When the controller firmware instructs KMB to load an MEK, the controller firmware can use the **AUX** value to specify which mode of operation should be used and which value should be used as an initialization vector or a nonce with the generated MEK.

##### Media Encryption Key register

Table: Offset SFR_Base + 40h: MEK ‚Äì Media Encryption Key {#tbl:ee-mek-sfr}

+-------+------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Bytes | Type | Reset | Description                                              |
+=======+======+=======+==========================================================+
| 63:00 | WO   | 0h    | **Media encryption key:** This field specifies a 512-bit |
|       |      |       | encryption key.                                          |
+-------+------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------+

The encryption engine is free to interpret the provided key in a vendor-defined manner. One sample interpretation for AES-XTS-512 is presented in @fig:mek-format-example-for-aes.

![MEK format example for AES-XTS-512](./diagrams/mek_register_aes_xts_512.drawio.svg){#fig:mek-format-example-for-aes}

If an algorithm used by the encryption engine does not require 512 bits of key material, the encryption engine is free to disregard unused bits.

Within KMB, loaded MEKs are only ever present in the Key Vault, so that they can be protected against any firmware-level attacks. KMB will write MEKs into the encryption engine's key cache using the DMA engine. Given an index and a destination identifier, the DMA engine will copy the key value stored in the given key vault slot to the destination address to which the DMA engine translates the destination identifier.

#### AES-XTS key validation requirements

FIPS 140-3 IG section C.I [@{fips-140-3-ig}] states that in AES-XTS, the key is "parsed as the concatenation of two AES keys, denoted by *Key_1* and *Key_2*, that are 128 [or 256] bits long... The module **shall** check explicitly that *Key_1* ‚â† *Key_2*, regardless of how *Key_1* and *Key_2* are obtained."

The encryption engine will be responsible for performing this check when in AES-XTS mode.

#### KMB command sequence

@fig:cmd-ee-example-uml shows a sample command execution. This is an expected sequence when the controller firmware instructs the KMB to load an MEK. The internal behavior of the encryption engine is one of several possible mechanisms, and can be different per vendor.

![Command execution example for loading an MEK](./diagrams/uml/cmd_ee_example.svg){#fig:cmd-ee-example-uml}

### Controller ‚Üí KMB interface

This section provides the mailbox commands exposed by Caliptra as part of OCP L.O.C.K.

Each of these commands returns a `fips_status` field. This provides an indicator of whether KMB is operating in FIPS mode. The values for this field are as follows:

+-------------+--------------------+
| Value       | Description        |
+=============+====================+

#### REWRAP_PMEK

This command unwraps access_key_1 and enc_access_key_2. Then access_key_1 is used to decrypt enc_access_key_2. The specified PMEK is decrypted using KDF(FEK, "PMEK", access_key_1). A new PMEK is encrypted with the output of KDF(FEK, "PMEK", access_key_2). The new encrypted PMEK is returned.

The Storage Controller stores the returned new encrypted PMEK. The Storage Controller may attempt to do a trial decryption the new PMEK without an error before deleting the old PMEK. Controller firmware zeroizes the old encrypted PMEK.

#### Fault handling

A KMB mailbox command can fail to complete in the following ways:

- An ill-formed command.
- Encryption engine timeout.
- Encryption engine reported error.

In all of these cases, the error is reported in the command return status.

Depending on the type of fault, controller firmware may resubmit the mailbox command.

Each mailbox command that causes a command to execute on the encryption engine includes a timeout value is specified by the command. KMB aborts the command executing on the encryption engine if the encryption engine does not complete the command within the specified timeout and reports a LOCK_ENGINE_TIMEOUT result code.

@tbl:kmb-mailbox-codes defines the additional mailbox result codes that may be returned by KMB.
