## Technical Advisory Committee

### Role & Responsibilities

The role of the Workgroup Technical Advisory Committee (“TAC”) is to represent
the interests of the Participants in the Workgroup and provide active technical
leadership for the Workgroup.

The responsibilities of these TAC roles within the Workgroup include:
- Merging pull requests and otherwise exercising the role of “Committers” for
  the Workgroup as defined in the CHIPS Alliance Technical Charter;
- Facilitating communication and collaboration between TAC members;
- Upholding the policies outlined in this document;
- Organizing public meetings and public technical discussions;
- Sharing any necessary meeting minutes in a public GitHub repository, a public
  Wiki, or on a public website for the Workgroup within a reasonable period of
  time after the meeting;
- Responding to technical questions on GitHub;
- Setting the technical criteria for use of the Workgroup marks (if applicable);
- Determining strategy and promoting the adoption of the Workgroup technology
  through documentation, talks, or other marketing;
- Determining whether additional public, open source repositories should be
  created for the Workgroup; and
- Determining whether any Workgroup open source collaborations should be wound
  down and archived on GitHub.

## Eligibility

`[The initial TAC members of the Workgroup will be representatives appointed by
[WORKGROUP FOUNDING ORGANIZATIONS], with one representative per organization.]`

Organizations who have joined the CHIPS Alliance and signed the CHIPS Alliance
Participation Agreement and CHIPS Alliance Contributor License Agreement are
eligible to nominate developer representatives to join the Workgroup TAC.

Developer representatives may join the TAC subject to a simple majority approval
vote by the existing TAC members in attendance of a TAC meeting, provided quorum
is met, or by electronic vote without a meeting, with a majority vote of all
voting members of the TAC.

Additionally, Volunteer Developers may join the TAC in their individual capacity
based on active contribution to the Workgroup open source repositories, subject
to a 2/3 approval vote by the existing TAC members, with all existing TAC
members participating in the vote. Such TAC membership decisions will be based
only on the technical quality of contributions made to the Workgroup open source
project.

All TAC technical discussions will be publicly accessible, either on public
Workgroup open source repositories on GitHub, on publicly accessible mailing
lists, or on calls that may be joined by any member of the public.

Any member of the Workgroup TAC may resign by submitting a pull request to
remove their name from the membership list document; the resignation will be
considered effectively immediately upon submitting the pull request. The TAC may
vote to remove a TAC member by a 2/3 vote with a majority of TAC members
participating. A CHIPS Alliance member may remove its TAC member representative
or replace its TAC member representative with an alternative employee
representative at any time.

The Workgroup TAC members will be listed by name or pseudonym and GitHub
username in a document within the Workgroup open source repository. Membership
changes are reflected by pull requests against the Workgroup TAC membership list
document.

### TAC Chair

The TAC may elect a Chair on an annual basis based on a majority vote by the TAC
members.

The TAC may determine the date of its annual Chair elections, with additional
elections as needed if a Chair resigns or otherwise needs to be replaced.  The
TAC Chair will:
- Represent the Workgroup in CHIPS Alliance Technical Steering Committee
  meetings per the CHIPS Alliance Technical Charter;
- Represent the Workgroup in discussions with Linux Foundation legal counsel
  with respect to trademark prosecution for the Workgroup marks (if applicable),
  on behalf of all Workgroup Participants; and
- Escalate any Code of Conduct concerns to the CHIPS Alliance TSC.

A TAC Chair may resign at any time. A TAC Chair may be removed from the position
of Chair by a 2/3 vote of the TAC members, with a majority of the TAC members
participating in the vote.

A former TAC Chair may continue to be a Participant in the Workgroup if there is
no other reason against it, e.g., if no adverse Code of Conduct determination
has been made.

## Volunteer Developers

The Workgroup welcomes contributions from members of the open source community.
All open source contributors who have signed the CHIPS Alliance Contributor
License Agreement, or who are covered by a CHIPS Alliance Contributor License
Agreement signed by their employer, are welcome as Workgroup Volunteer
Developers.

Volunteer Developers can contribute to the Workgroup open source project via
pull requests on GitHub and participation in Workgroup meetings and technical
discussions. Volunteer Developers do not have voting rights. Volunteers are
encouraged to review and comment on pending pull requests to the Workgroup open
source repositories, but they cannot accept pull requests on behalf of the
Workgroup.

Not all suggested contributions will be merged by the Workgroup TAC, and
Volunteer Developers will not have commit rights or edit rights for the
Workgroup open source project.

The Workgroup will recognize Volunteer Developers if individuals request to be
added to a list of Workgroup Volunteer Developers, to be maintained in a
document in the Workgroup open source repository alongside, or in the same
document as, the list of official TAC members. It is not necessary to be
included in the listed individual Volunteer Developers in Workgroup
documentation to be considered a Volunteer Developer.

Volunteer Developers are welcome to join all meetings, mailing lists, and
discussions on GitHub. Volunteer Developers do not have any required
responsibilities to the Workgroup.

Volunteer Developers may become TAC members according to the process outlined
regarding the addition of new members to the TAC.

## Amendments

This Charter may be amended by a 2/3 vote of the TAC with a participating
majority of listed TAC members. The vote may be conducted (1) in a meeting with
meeting minutes noting which TAC members were present and how they voted; (2)
over email, or (3) via participation in a pull request discussion on GitHub.

Workgroup TAC votes to amend the Workgroup Charter will be subject to a veto by
the CHIPS Alliance Board, to be exercised when a Charter amendment may
unacceptably depart from the purpose of the CHIPS Alliance or unreasonably
increase risk for CHIPS Alliance participants.
