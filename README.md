# Caliptra

Caliptra consists of IP and firmware for an integrated Root of Trust block.

Caliptra targets datacenter-class SoCs like CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, TPUs. It is the
specification, silicon logic, ROM and firmware for implementing a Root of Trust
for Measurement (RTM) block inside an SoC. A Caliptra integration provides the
SoC with Identity, Measured Boot and Attestation capabilities.

## Organizations

Caliptra is a project originally incepted at the Open Compute Project
([OCP](https://www.opencompute.org/)).  The major revisions of the Caliptra
specifications are published at OCP. The evolving source code and documentation
for Caliptra live in this repository within the [CHIPS Alliance
Project](https://chipsalliance.org/), a Series of LF Projects, LLC.

## Governance

The [Caliptra WorkGroup Technical Charter](Caliptra_WG_Technical_Charter.md)
sets out the charter governing the Caliptra project.

## Discussion Channels

The Caliptra workgroup meets every Friday at 9am PT. Meeting invite and agenda
are posted to the [mailing list](https://lists.chipsalliance.org/g/caliptra-wg).

A [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/caliptraworkspace/signup)
is used for interactive discussions. Keep in mind development activity is focused on
GitHub issues and Pull Request reviews, rarely on the Slack channel. If you have
issues joining please contact the mailing list.

Please sign the [CHIPS CLA](https://github.com/chipsalliance/tsc/tree/main/cla)
(as an individual or your
[company](https://github.com/chipsalliance/tsc/blob/main/cla/CLA-status.yml) if
affiliated) before participating in these channels.
