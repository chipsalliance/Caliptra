# Caliptra

Caliptra consists of IP and firmware for an integrated Root of Trust block.

Caliptra targets datacenter-class SoCs like CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, TPUs. It is the
specification, silicon logic, ROM and firmware for implementing a Root of Trust
for Measurement (RTM) block inside an SoC. A Caliptra integration provides the
SoC with Identity, Measured Boot and Attestation capabilities.

## Organizations

Caliptra is a project originally incepted at the Open Compute Project
([OCP](https://www.opencompute.org/)).  The major revisions of the Caliptra
specifications are published at OCP. The evolving source code and documentation
for Caliptra live in this repository within the [CHIPS Alliance
Project](https://chipsalliance.org/), a Series of LF Projects, LLC.

## Governance

The [Caliptra WorkGroup Technical Charter](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Caliptra/blob/main/CaliptraWGTechnicalCharter.md)
sets out the charter governing the Caliptra project and [its
marks](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Caliptra/blob/main/CaliptraTrademarkPolicy.md).

## Versioning

Caliptra is released in independently versioned components: RTL, ROM, FMC and Runtime FW. They are all represented by 3 values: major.minor.patch (such as 1.0.2). The first 2 values, major.minor, correspond to a set of features caliptra supports. The patch value is incremented as new releases are made with bug fixes.

Not all components necessarily need to be of the same major.minor version to be compatible. Details are below:
