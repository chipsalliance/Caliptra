# Caliptra

Caliptra consists of IP and firmware for an integrated Root of Trust block.

Caliptra targets datacenter-class SoCs like CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, TPUs. It is the
specification, silicon logic, ROM and firmware for implementing a Root of Trust
for Measurement (RTM) block inside an SoC. A Caliptra integration provides the
SoC with Identity, Measured Boot and Attestation capabilities.

## Organizations

Caliptra is a project originally incepted at the Open Compute Project
([OCP](https://www.opencompute.org/)).  The major revisions of the Caliptra
specifications are published at OCP. The evolving source code and documentation
for Caliptra live in this repository within the [CHIPS Alliance
Project](https://chipsalliance.org/), a Series of LF Projects, LLC.
