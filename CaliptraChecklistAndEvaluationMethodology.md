# Introduction

The **Caliptra Checklist and Evaluation Methodology** document serves as a comprehensive guide for ensuring the secure and correct integration of the Caliptra intellectual property (IP) into a system-on-chip (SoC). Caliptra is a hardware root-of-trust (RoT) IP designed to provide foundational security services within a computing system. Proper integration of Caliptra is crucial to maintaining the overall security posture of the final product.

This document outlines detailed requirements and evaluation methodologies across various domains, including asset management, interface implementations, and secure process adherence. The primary goals are to:

* **Ensure security compliance:** Provide clear and testable requirements that align with industry best practices and standards, such as those from NIST and FIPS.  
    
* **Facilitate evaluation:** Offer comprehensive evaluation methodologies that allow for consistent and thorough assessment of compliance with the checklist items.

* **Promote clarity and specificity:** Avoid vague language by specifying exact requirements, thereby making the checklist actionable and reducing ambiguity during the evaluation process.

* **Address critical security areas:** Focus on key areas that have significant impact on the security of Caliptra integration, such as cryptographic key management, secure boot processes, and access control mechanisms.

* **Enhance integration efficiency:** By providing a clear roadmap of requirements, the document aims to streamline the integration process and assist manufacturers in proactively addressing security considerations.

The checklist items have been developed through a thorough analysis of:

* **Caliptra specifications:** Reviewing the Caliptra IP documentation to extract relevant requirements and ensure alignment with the intended security features.  
    
* **Industry standards and best practices:** Incorporating guidelines from recognized standards to enhance the robustness of security mechanisms.

* **Feedback and collaboration:** Integrating input from various stakeholders, including security experts and industry professionals, to refine the checklist and address potential gaps.

* **Asset-based analysis:** Identifying critical assets within the Caliptra integration context and tailoring requirements to protect these assets effectively.

By adhering to the checklist and employing the specified evaluation methodologies, manufacturers and evaluators can work collaboratively to ensure that the Caliptra integration meets stringent security requirements, thereby bolstering the trustworthiness of the final product.

### Key Words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

# Caliptra Documentation

The Caliptra Specification is maintained within the [ChipsAlliance Caliptra repository](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Caliptra/blob/main/doc/Caliptra.md).  This is a live link. Each generation, the main specification will be updated and the older specifications will be maintained for reference for designs based on that specification.  For example, here is the specification for [Calitpra 1.X](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Caliptra/blob/main/doc/caliptra_1x/Caliptra.md).

The [HW specification](https://github.com/chipsalliance/caliptra-rtl/blob/main/docs/CaliptraHardwareSpecification.md) and [HW integration specification](https://github.com/chipsalliance/caliptra-rtl/blob/main/docs/CaliptraIntegrationSpecification.md) also have their own live links. For previous versions of the hardware specification, go to the location that is tagged with that release version.

This checklist is built from these specifications with the goal to help ensure that Caliptra is integrated correctly within a design.
